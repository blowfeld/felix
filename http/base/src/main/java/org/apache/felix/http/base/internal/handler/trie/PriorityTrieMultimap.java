/**
 * {@code PriorityTrieMultimap} is a colored trie structure for retrieval of highest priority elements.
 * <p>
 * The {@code PriorityTrieMultimap} provides storage of collections of values
 * against {@link SearchPath} keys which represent a node in the trie.
 * Depending on the used {@code SearchPath}s, lookup matches the key with the
 * longest matching sub-path (prefix). It structure corresponds to a
 * <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie">Trie</a> that allows for multiple
 * values associated with each node.
 * <p>
 * Each key can be associated with multiple values, where each value has a
 * priority and can be associated with a color. The color resulting from the
 * values stored in a node (key) is the color with the highest priority
 * associated with those values. The color of a node in the trie is determined
 * by the following rules:
 * <ul>
 *  <li>a node inherits the color from its parent if that is of higher priority
 *      than the color resulting from its values</li>
 *  <li>if the parent has no color or the parent color is of lower priority,
 *      the color of the node is the color resulting from its values</li>
 * </ul>
 * {@code SearchPath} keys can be defined to be ignored in the color inheritance.
 * In that case they pass on the color of their parent.
 * <p>
 * A node in the trie is considered active if the color resulting from its
 * values has the same priority than the color associated with the node.
 * <p>
 * Value retrieval from a node provides the value that has the highest
 * priority among the values associated with the highest priority color of the
 * values stored in the node.
 * <p>
 * The priority of colors and values is determined from their natural ordering
 * and the <em>least</em> element with respect to this ordering has the highest
 * priority.
 * <p>
 * Instances of {@code PriorityTrieMultimap} must be thread safe.
 *
 * @param <V> the value type to be stored in the {@code PriorityTrieMultimap}
 * @param <C> the color type
